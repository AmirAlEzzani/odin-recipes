        <h1><strong>Reuben Sandwich</strong></h1>
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A Reuben is a grilled sandwich featuring corned beef on rye bread. The Reuben is a menu staple in Jewish-style delicatessens, but it's not technically kosher because it combines meat and cheese. A traditional reuben sandwich consists of thinly sliced corned beef, Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut<br>on rye bread slathered with Russian or Thousand Island dressing.</p>
